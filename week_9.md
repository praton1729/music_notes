# Week - 9 Theory

## Finding the root

- `AAO`: Alphabetical Ascending Order.

### Rule no 1

- 2 minor chords which have 1 tone gap e.g. Cm and Dm.
- Take the chord which alphabetically comes first.
- The 1 tone ancestor note of the root note of the selected chord will be
  the root note of the scale.

#### Example

- Take the chord progression Dm, Em, G, Am.
- Select Dm and Em.
- Root is C.

### Rule no 2

- 2 major chords which have 1 tone gap e.g. C and D.
- Take the chord which alphabetically comes second.
- The 1 tone successor note of the root note of the selected chord.
- You will have the relative minor of the root.
- Add 1.5 tone to get the root note of the scale.

#### Example

- Take the chord progression D, Bm, G, A.
- Select G and A.
- 1 tone successor of A is B.
- Bm is relative minor of D.
- Root is D.


### Rule no 3

- Chord progression has a 7th chord.
- Add 1 tone to the root note of the 7th chord.
- You will have the relative minor of the root.
- Add 1.5 tone to get the root note of the scale.

#### Example

- Take the chord progression F, Dm, C7.
- 1 tone successor of C is D.
- Dm is relative minor of F.
- Root is F.

## Harmonic minor

- A minor scale of which the 7th note is sharpened.

## Melodic minor

- Basically its the minor scale but in the case of ascending we will sharpen the
  6th and 7th note.
- While descending we will play the natural minor scale.
