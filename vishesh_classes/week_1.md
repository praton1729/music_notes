# Week - 14 Started classes with Vishesh Kapil

## Notes from Vishesh

- Major scale is symmetric if we split it in half.
- First half: `R W W H` & then a whole step jump and repeat the first
  half in new position.

## What to practice

- Practice major scale on a single string with backing track.
	- Try it with all root notes.
	- Try to improvise by skipping notes.
	- Send an improvisation recording to vishesh before next class
- Record audio/video for everything to move on
